# Defaults
A macOS app written in SwiftUI to tinker with Apple's UserDefaults system, makes life a tad bit easier by eliminating the complexity to remember the keys and, having to read the current value and it's type before setting a new value.

# How to use?
Start by typing the bundle identifier to view a list of available keys which you can click on to view the type of value, current value and set a new value.
